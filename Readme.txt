Thank you for downloading YOGEME, the all-in-one mission editor for the X-Wing
series, TIE95 through X-wing Alliance.  This program allows easy mission
creation for all of your favorite Star Wars flight sims in a single platform,
and has abilities and mission parameters that have been discovered since the
original mainstream editors were created.

Installation Notes

No special setup is needed, simply unzip and run. YOGEME will auto-detect your
installed platforms and enable those editing capabilities (you shouldn't be
making missions for a platform you can't play, they tend to be bug-ridden),
however if you absolutely need a disabled platform, it can be activated in the
Options dialog. Note however that certain functions may not work properly for
an uninstalled platform.

==========
Uninstallation Notes

Run Uninstall.exe, it will remove the settings file in your user directory and
all original YOGEME files.

==========
Special Thanks

All the modders and programmers over the last 15 years who started the grunt
work that made editors like this possible, notably Evan Sabatelli for TIE
Fighter Workshop, Troy Dangerfield for both XvtED and AlliED, and countless
others who did the initial research into the mission file formats.
